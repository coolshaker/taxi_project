# taxi_project
The objectives of this project are: 1) to explore how taxi usage is related with factors such as population, median income, road network and public transit accessibility; and 2) to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of taxi usage. Census tracts are used as the basic geographic units to capture taxi usage, transportation, land use, demographic and socioeconomic data. A Hadoop MapReduce program is designed to compute the monthly taxi pick-ups and drop-offs for each census tract. Bayesian hierarchical models with spatial and temporal effect terms are used to identify the contributing factors to taxi trips. Seven explanatory variables including bus station number, subway station number, bike rack number, road density, median income, employment, and population are found to affect taxi usage significantly. September, May and March are expected to be the top three months which have the highest taxi usage; while the February and November are predicted to among those which have lowest taxi usage. Additionally, the spatial patterns of taxi trips are investigated and the unobserved heterogeneity among NTA has been confirmed. Understanding the impacts of contributing factors to taxi usage and the spatio-temporal patterns can provide insights to aid in better planning, design and management of taxi operation system.
